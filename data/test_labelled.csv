I can't believe you guys removed one of the most useful features of Evernote, which was the ability to style lines as either a section, subsection, paragraph or blockquote That was the only way we could give some hierarchy to our notes  Now all my notes are one dimensional and its impossible to organize my thoughts How could the Evernote team consider that this feature was unnecessary? Do you guys not use your own app? How am I supposed to outline my notes?

537,"Great App Gets Better! This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.  There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:  1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row. 2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen? 3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.  Keep up the good work!",P,P,3.3992023

Why do I have to block it as well if 50 other people have already said it was negative. If no one has rated the number and I haven't rated it sure allow the pop up with options.

HOWEVER, that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing. I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free, so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing.   This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in-game payments of this sort. I HATE this type of payment system. I would much rather buy the game up-front for $1, $2, or even $3.

You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free...I thought the same thing and finally ponied up (do you really spend *that* much more/less on a cup of coffee?) and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable. Time tables are pretty accurate, but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps, not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you. Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way, and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab.

The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated.

I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

From the beginning I was struggling with the Bookmark on how to access it quicker,  and on how to exit the browser.  Well,  both can be solved easily. For the Bookmark, I set my Homepage to Bookmark, all my bookmarks are up when the browser starts. For the exit, there is menu at the top-left of the browser where you would have New Tab created, close all Tabs will exit the browser.  I think those are intended, then needed to document.  However, add Bookmark and Exit buttons to the address bar is arguable better option.   Update 04/2016: I have been using Butterfly for a long time. One wish I may ask: add Zoom Buttons, similar to UC Browser. This in really useful for users who surf internet on TV box.
